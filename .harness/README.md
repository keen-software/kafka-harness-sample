# Build and Test Apache Kafka on Harness CI

This is a fork of Apache Kafka project. This project was used to demo the new capabilities of Harness CI at [Unscripted Conference 2022](https://www.unscriptedconf.io/). This file contains instructions on how to run the Apache Kafka pipeline shown during the demo.

## Setting up this pipeline on Harness CI Hosted Builds

1. Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com) or use an existing one

2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/harness-community/kafka/fork) into your GitHub account. 

3. If you are new to Harness CI, signup for [Harness CI](https://app.harness.io/auth/#/signup)
  * Select the `Continuous Integration` module and choose the `Starter pipeline` wizard to create your first pipeline using the forked repo from #2.
  * Go to the newly created pipeline and hit the `Triggers`tab. If everything went well, you should see two triggers auto-created. A `Pull Request`trigger and a `Push`trigger. For this exercise, we only need `Pull Request`trigger to be enabled. So, please disable or delete the `Push`trigger.

4. If you are an existing Harness CI user, create a new pipeline to use the cloud option for infrastructure and setup the PR trigger.

5. Enable Test Intelligence:  

* Edit the pipeline yaml in the yaml editor to add this new step:  
```
- step:
    type: RunTests
    name: Run Tests with Intelligence
    identifier: Run_Tests_with_Intelligence
    spec:
      language: Java
      buildTool: Gradle
      args: "--build-cache unitTest -PmaxParallelForks=32 -PignoreFailures=true"
      packages: org.apache.kafka,kafka.test,kafka.testkit,kafka.server,kafka.tools,kafka.examples,test.plugins
      runOnlySelectedTests: true
      preCommand: ls
      reports:
        type: JUnit
        spec:
          paths:
            - "**/*.xml"
```
* The generated yaml should look like below.

* Create a Pull Request in a new branch by updating the `build.gradle`file. (e.g. add a comment or new line). This should trigger a build in Harness CI

* Merge the PR after the pipeline runs successfully.

9. Enable GitHub Actions : The repository forked in Step 2 already has a `GitHub Actions` workflow file added. You can choose to enable this workflow from the `Actions` tab on GitHub.

10. Create any other `Pull Request` with a few source or test file changes. You can consider cherry-picking any of the commits from the `Apache Kafka` repo such as [this one](https://github.com/harness-community/kafka/pull/2)

11. This PR will trigger the Harness CI pipeline (as well as GitHub Actions workflow if enabled in Step-9). Depending on what files got changed in the PR, only those tests related to the changed source/test code will be selected to run in the Harness pipeline. GitHub Actions workflow, however, will run all the unit tests for every PR.
